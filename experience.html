        <h2>Trip plan</h2>
        <p>This three days two nights minority village exploration will take you through astonishing
          hill ranges of northern Shan State. You will encounter friendly Shan and Palaung villagers and
          learn about the tea farming traditions of the region. Feeling of remoteness is one of the great
          experiences while trekking on small side tracks surrounded by mighty forested hills and mountains.
          In this area people still live simple and traditional lives and some of the villages get foreign
         visitors quite rarely. Trek is moderate level and suited for people with basic health and sense of adventure.
